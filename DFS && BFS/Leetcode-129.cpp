/*      129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers          https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/
You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.
Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.
For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.
