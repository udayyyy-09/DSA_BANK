## Check if a given Binary Tree is a Heap

Given the root of a binary tree, determine whether the tree satisfies the heap property.

Binary tree needs to fulfill the following two conditions for being a heap:

It should be a complete tree (i.e. Every level of the tree, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.).

Every node’s value should be greater than or equal to its child node (considering max-heap).
