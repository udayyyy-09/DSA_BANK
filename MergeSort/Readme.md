📌 Merge Sort – Explanation 
🔹 What is Merge Sort?ℹ️
Merge Sort is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm that splits the array into two halves, sorts them recursively, and then merges the sorted halves back together.

💡 How does Merge Sort work?
🔷 Algorithm Steps↗️
▫️Divide the array into two halves.
▫️Recursively sort both halves using Merge Sort.
▫️Merge the two sorted halves to form a fully sorted array.

🔷 Merge Sort Example
Let's consider an example array:

Input: [5, 3, 8, 6, 2, 7, 4, 1]

Step-by-Step Breakdown:

▫️ Divide: Split into two halves → [5, 3, 8, 6] and [2, 7, 4, 1]
▫️ Recursively divide further until single elements remain.
▫️ Merge: Combine elements back in sorted order.


🔷 Time Complexity
▫️Best Case: O(N log N)
▫️Average Case: O(N log N)
▫️Worst Case: O(N log N)

🔷 Space Complexity
O(N) – Due to the extra space required for merging*



NOTE🚨
You can find the implementaion of MergeSort using both array and vectors✅.
