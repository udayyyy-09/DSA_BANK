Given an integer array nums, return an array answer where:

answer[i] = product of all elements of nums except nums[i]


You must solve the problem:

Without using division

In O(n) time

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

Constraints

2 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10⁵

-30 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 30

The product will always fit in a signed 32-bit integer.

Must run in O(n) time.

No division allowed.
