# 3799. Word Squares II

You are given a string array words, consisting of distinct 4-letter strings, each containing lowercase English letters.

A word square consists of 4 distinct words: top, left, right and bottom, arranged as follows:

- top forms the top row.
- bottom forms the bottom row.
- left forms the left column (top to bottom).
- right forms the right column (top to bottom).

It must satisfy:

- top[0] == left[0], top[3] == right[0]
- bottom[0] == left[3], bottom[3] == right[3]

Return all valid distinct word squares, sorted in ascending lexicographic order by the 4-tuple (top, left, right, bottom)​​​​​​​

#### Example 1:
 
        Input: words = ["able","area","echo","also"]

        Output: [["able","area","echo","also"],["area","able","also","echo"]]

        Explanation:

        There are exactly two valid 4-word squares that satisfy all corner constraints:

        "able" (top), "area" (left), "echo" (right), "also" (bottom)
        top[0] == left[0] == 'a'
        top[3] == right[0] == 'e'
        bottom[0] == left[3] == 'a'
        bottom[3] == right[3] == 'o'
        "area" (top), "able" (left), "also" (right), "echo" (bottom)
        All corner constraints are satisfied.
        Thus, the answer is [["able","area","echo","also"],["area","able","also","echo"]].

#### Example 2:

        Input: words = ["code","cafe","eden","edge"]

        Output: []

        Explanation:

        No combination of four words satisfies all four corner constraints. Thus, the answer is empty array [].

 

### Constraints:

4 <= words.length <= 15
words[i].length == 4
words[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.
All words[i] are distinct.

### Approach 

As Constraints are very small just use 4 loops as any string can be top,left,right,bottom
