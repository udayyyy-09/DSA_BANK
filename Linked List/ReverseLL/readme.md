# 206. Reverse a Linked List

![alt text](image.png)

### Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000

# ApproachðŸ“Œ

There are two primary ways to reverse a linked list:

Iterative Approach (Preferred for most cases)

Recursive Approach (Useful for understanding recursion)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Iterative Approach

Algorithm Steps

1. Initialize three pointers:

prev = nullptr (Previous node)

curr = head (Current node)

next = nullptr (Next node)

2. Traverse the list:

Store next = curr->next.

Reverse the link: curr->next = prev.

Move pointers forward: prev = curr, curr = next.

3. Update the new head to prev (last node of the original list).

### Time Complexity

Time: O(n) (Single pass through the list)

Space: O(1) (In-place reversal)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Recursive Approach

Algorithm Steps

Base Case: If head is nullptr or head->next is nullptr, return head.

Recursively reverse the rest of the list (head->next).

Fix the links:

head->next->next = head (Reverse the link).

head->next = nullptr (Break the old link).

Return the new head (from the base case).

Time Complexity
Time: O(n) (Each node processed once)

Space: O(n) (Recursion stack)
